# Scikit-learn exercises

A few exercises using Python and machine learning algorithms written scikit-learn.

 * `regression.ipynb`: Implements linear regression, stochastic gradient descent, Ridge and Lasso regression and Elastic Net using the [Boston House Prices data set](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices)

 *  `batch-gradient-descent.ipynb`: Implement Batch Gradient Descent with early stopping for Softmax Regression (without using Scikit-Learn). Notebook is `batch-gradient-descent.ipynb`.
 
 * `svm-regressor`: Implements an SVM regressor on the California housing dats set.
 
 * `svm-classifier`: Train an SVM classifier on the MNIST data set, using one-versus-the-rest to classify all 10 digits.
 
 * `regression.ipynb`: Regression analysis on the housing values in the suburbs of Boston, from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
 
 * `cctv-camera.ipynb`: Regression analysis on the correlation between crime rate and number of closed-circuit cameras per inhabitant in different countries around the world.
 
 * `decision-tree-withmoons-example.ipynb`: Clustering and classification using the `Make_Moons` data set from Scikit-Learn, which is a a simple toy dataset that makes two interleaving half circles
