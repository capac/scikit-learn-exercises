    "The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by the Gorkha earthquake.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're trying to predict the ordinal variable `damage_grade`, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. represents low damage\n",
    " 2. represents a medium amount of damage\n",
    " 3. represents almost complete destruction\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of damage is an ordinal variable meaning that ordering is important. This can be viewed as a classification or an ordinal regression problem. \n",

    "To measure the performance of our algorithms, we'll use the _F1 score_ which balances the precision and recall of a classifier. Traditionally, the F1 score is used to evaluate performance on a binary classifier, but since we have three possible labels we will use a variant called the _micro averaged F1 score_.\n",
